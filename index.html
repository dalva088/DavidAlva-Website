I'm David Alva, I was born February 5th, 2003, in Anaheim, Orange County California. I'm a sophomore attending UC Riverside and I'm majoring in Economics/Administrative Studies. My hobbies are working out, playing soccer, playing video games and hanging out with the homies. My favorite fast food is TacoBell and Wingstop has the best ranch. My profession and studies in Economics and Business are a great asset of mine in which I use to further help people with any work they need in that area. I will soon have a real estate license in the near future and that will become my main profession and job. My future goals is to have a nice job making anywhere over $60,000 a year and to be consistently traveling every year. I love traveling and I want to know all the beautiful places this earth has to offer.
In the summer of 2022. I spent a month in Peru and 2 months traveling around Europe. The place I enjoyed the most in Europe was Barcelona, Spain. I also got to see my favorite and the best soccer player in the world Lionel Messi. I grew up playing soccer and my biggest inspiration for it was Messi. Being able to see him play was a dream come true to me. Seeing other players like Neymar, Mbappe, Ramos, and Veratti was also mind blowing and an experience I'll never forget. I spent a month in Peru spending time and making endless memories with my family. My family and I are all Peruvian aswell and we are very proud especially of are food.This bio sucks honestly. I'm just writing random stuff down to get around the 500 word mark. I don't know what else to talk about it. But writing this right now works out, I'm getting my words in. I really like to eat McDonald's. If you like McDonald's then make sure you get the app because there are so many good deals on there and a good reward system aswell. My favorite class this semester is honestly probably this class, CS8. There's a bit of busy work but I've been luckily enjoing it a bit. I even find the class lecture and the subject interesting which is wierd because I rarely find interest in things. I'm at around 390 words now which means I got around 100 left and I'm really done writing this I'm out of ideas. I don't got a profession I ain't going to lie. I've barely worked a year out of my 19 at a place called Round 1. It was fun I enjoyed my time there and I met some good people and made good memories there. I would like to go back and work it as a summer job. I think after I finish writing this nonsense I might be at about the 500 words that I need. My favorite animal is a Koala, they're chill.
